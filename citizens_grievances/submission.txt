predict_importance_sklearn-submission.ipynb contains detailed EDA and method to create prediction model. Model runs on test data to generate predictions.

**EDA**
* unique values, percent null values in each feature is observed
* Features with >99% null are dropped

**Feature engineering**
* Datetime feature is dissagregated into month, quarter, day of week, year
* sklearn pipeline is used to onehot-encode and descretize necessary features

**Prediction**
* RandomForestClassifier is used to predict target class 'importance'
* Hyperparameters for model are tunned using grid search
* Attain ~86% classification accuracy and F1 score in cross validation
